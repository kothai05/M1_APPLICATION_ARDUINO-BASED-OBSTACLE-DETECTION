INTRODUCTION:
        
          This is an obstacle avoidance robot made with Arduino. The robot detects obstacles in its path by using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. A servo motor allows the sensor to "scan" the area in front of it (~180Â°). The robot generally will travel in a straight line. When an obstacle is detected, the robot will make a decision on whether to turn around, or continue travelling if the obstacle has cleared.

The robot can detect obstacles in front, left, and right by it's sweeping scanner. Therefore, obstacle behind will not be detected, and it is possible to "box in" the robot.
 
 FEATURE:
 
     Lower battery voltage than normal (1.5V) will affect behavior the robot, and may cause unexpected movements. For example, it may not turn enough to clear the obstacle.

Symptoms of low battery include the robot not travelling straight, not clearing the obstacle, or "stuttering" start-stop movement.


COST:

  Affordable cost and nowdays many of the companies, industries and organisations .
   
   
SWOT ANALYSIS:
 
 This project is use full for elder people in emergency alert.
The system detects the abnormal activity and sends immediately an emergency alert

4W's and 1'H:

  What-This project is very use full for human fall activity for use of elder people.
When-The system detects the abnormal activity and sends immediately an emergency alert
Why-The tools organise this information in a way that makes it easy for you to find the entires again the data may also be searchable.
How-it works simple and easily using Ultrasonic Sensor
